Project Overview 📌  
User success is a critical metric for SaaS platforms, yet identifying at-risk users early remains a challenge. This project analyzes user activity data to uncover behavioral signals associated with successful and unsuccessful user outcomes.

The insights generated through this analysis help product, growth, and customer success teams take proactive, data-driven decisions.

Analytical Approach 🧠  
The project follows a structured analytics workflow:

- Performed exploratory analysis to understand overall user behavior and engagement trends  
- Engineered behavior-based features such as sessions, events, active days, and interaction depth  
- Built predictive models to classify users as Successful or At-Risk  
- Designed clear and interpretable visualizations to communicate insights effectively  

Key Insights 📈  
Some of the most meaningful findings from the analysis include:

- Early and consistent engagement is strongly correlated with long-term user success  
- Users with broader interaction patterns across features tend to retain longer  
- At-risk users typically exhibit limited activity depth and shorter engagement windows  

Tools and Technologies 🛠️  
The project was implemented using the following tools:

- Python for data processing and modeling  
- Pandas and NumPy for data manipulation  
- Scikit-learn for predictive modeling  
- Matplotlib and Seaborn for data visualization  
- Zerve platform for interactive analytics and deployment
