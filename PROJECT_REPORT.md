Zerve User Success Analytics – Project Report 📊

Introduction  
User success and long-term retention are critical for the growth of any SaaS platform. However, identifying early behavioral patterns that indicate whether a user will succeed or disengage remains a challenge. This project focuses on analyzing user behavior data to uncover meaningful signals that differentiate successful users from at-risk users.

The project was developed as part of the Zerve Hackathon with the goal of applying practical analytics and machine learning techniques to real-world user success problems.

Objective 🎯  
The primary objectives of this project are:
- To understand how early engagement patterns influence long-term user success  
- To identify behavioral differences between successful and at-risk users  
- To translate analytical findings into actionable insights for product and growth teams  

Dataset Overview 📂  
The analysis is based on the Zerve hackathon dataset, which captures user interaction and engagement signals, including:
- Session-level activity
- Event and feature usage
- Engagement timelines
- Retention-related indicators

Initial exploration focused on understanding the structure of the data, identifying trends, and ensuring data quality before proceeding with modeling.

Methodology 🧠  

Exploratory Analysis  
User activity patterns were explored to understand engagement distributions and behavioral trends. Comparisons were made between successful and at-risk users to identify early divergence points in usage behavior.

Feature Engineering  
Behavior-based features were engineered to better represent user intent and engagement, including:
- Session frequency and consistency  
- Active days and engagement depth  
- Interaction diversity across features and workflows  

Modeling Approach  
Multiple machine learning models were evaluated to predict user success outcomes:
- Logistic Regression  
- Random Forest  
- Gradient Boosting  

Models were assessed based on predictive performance and interpretability to ensure the results remained actionable for business use cases.

Key Insights 📈  
The analysis revealed several meaningful patterns:
- Early and consistent engagement is strongly associated with long-term user success  
- Users with broader interaction patterns tend to retain better over time  
- At-risk users typically show early drops in activity depth and session frequency  

Visualization and Insights Delivery 📊  
Interactive dashboards were created to visualize:
- Behavioral differences between successful and at-risk users  
- Engagement trends over time  
- High-impact features influencing user success  

These visualizations support fast, intuitive decision-making for stakeholders.

Business Impact 💡  
The insights from this project can help teams:
- Improve onboarding and activation strategies  
- Identify at-risk users early and intervene proactively  
- Design data-driven engagement and retention initiatives  

Conclusion 🏁  
This project demonstrates how structured analytics and machine learning can be used to understand and predict user success. By focusing on clarity, interpretability, and real-world applicability, the solution bridges the gap between raw user data and actionable product decisions.
